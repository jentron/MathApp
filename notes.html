<p>Dr. Fry,</p>

<p>I am much more interested in continuing the MathAPP page (assignment 6) than building yet another Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Since time is a limited commodity, and I am at capacity this semester I am wondering if you would consider allowing me to enhance the MathAPP instead of doing the Rock, Paper, Scissors projects?</p>

<p>I propose to: </p>

<p>Create a "Settings" page as a modal dialog that opens with a standard "settings" gear icon. This page would enable the user to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum number size, 9, 12, 16 or 99. <span class="note">Javascript support in MathTest class inplace</span></li>
<li>Whether to use negative numbers <span class="note"> Javascript support in MathTest inplace</span></li>
<li>Which game mode to use</li>
<li>Possibly display numbers and parse results in hexadecimal?</li>
</ul>
<p>Add Game Modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practice Mode: Random questions from the selected (currently 4) question types. A timer will run showing elapsed time, open ended.</li>
<li>Minute to Win It Mode: Answer as many questions correctly as possible in 60 seconds (time as a setting)</li>
<li>Twenty Questions Mode: Answer 20 questions correctly as rapidly as possible. (number as a setting)</li>
<li>Game interface will change as appropriate based on mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add Log In/Log Out button to change user names or anonymous. </p>

<p>Add Timer/Stop Watch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Count up/Count Down</li>
<li>Start, stop, reset, lap, set, mode, event trigger</li>
<li>Game will use timer automatically based on Game Mode</li>
<li>Lap recorder</li>
</ul>
<p>Scoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of question, answer, elapsed time, etc.</li>
<li>Display information as a table below the game</li>
<li>Downloadable as a JSON file (looking forward to writing to a database)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ron Jensen</p>

<p>Anybody else but you and I would be concerned.</p>
<p>However, this is challenging enough, and has my approval.</p>
