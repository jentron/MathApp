A Javascript web-page app started as a final project for cs2350

I propose to:

Create a "Settings" page as a modal dialog that opens with a standard "settings" gear icon. This page would enable the user to choose:

*   The maximum number size, 9, 12, 16 or 99. **DONE.**
*   Whether to use negative numbers **DONE.**
*   Which game mode to use. Settings **DONE.**
*   ~~Possibly display numbers and parse results in hexadecimal.~~

Add Game Modes:

*   Practice Mode: Random questions from the selected (currently 4) question types. A timer will run showing elapsed time, open ended.
*   Minute to Win It Mode: Answer as many questions correctly as possible in 60 seconds (time as a setting)
*   Twenty Questions Mode: Answer 20 questions correctly as rapidly as possible. (number as a setting)
*   Game interface will change as appropriate based on mode.

Add Log In/Log Out button to change user names or anonymous. **DONE**

Add Timer/Stop Watch:

*   Count up/Count Down
*   Start, stop, reset, lap, set, mode, event trigger
*   Game will use timer automatically based on Game Mode
*   Lap recorder

Scoring:

*   Keep track of question, answer, elapsed time, etc.
*   Display information as a table below the game
*   Downloadable as a JSON file (looking forward to writing to a database)

Thanks,

Ron Jensen
